# Computer Vision Application

This project consists of four small applications in computer vision. 
All the applications are written in MATLAB. 

- `Filters` compares efficiency of Wiener filters in frequency domain and spatial domain with a photo under low light conditions, and also compares Wiener filter and Gaussian filter for denoising and apply bilateral filter to improve results
- `GeoCalibration` performs camera calibration with checkerboard and estimates extrinsic camera parameters with given intrinsic parameters and 6 pairs of points
- `Noise & WB` estimates the sensor noise in the camera and adjusts the white balance of the camera
- `SIFT` implements the front-end of David Lowe's SIFT  feature detector.
